# pdf_service

All static methods in PDFServiceHandlers are using iTextSharp PDF library.
These are what I actually use in a couple of my applications currently.

**PDF_MergeFiles - merge all given PDF files into a single PDF file**

Place these two source files in your project to consume static methods in PDFServiceHandlers.cp file.
